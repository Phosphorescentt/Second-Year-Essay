\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The canonical example}
Let us consider the example from the abstract of water filtering through a porus medium, but this time in two dimensions. How do we model this? One might imagine that the medium consists of
many particles arranged (for simplicity) in an $n \times n$ square lattice and linked to each of their nearest neighbours. Clearly, this is the lattice on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. To setup the problem,
each of the particles will be expressed as a vertex in a graph and each of the links will be an edge. In the context of percolation, a vertex is called a site and an edge is
called a bond; these sites and bonds form a network. (We're sure the reader can visualise $\mathbb{Z}^2$, but just in case they can't, they may refer to figure
\ref{fig:square lattice} beneath) \\

So what does percolation actually mean? First we shall introduce the notion of open and closed sites and bonds and then we can discuss percolation.

\begin{definition}\label{def:open}
  A site or bond in a network is labeled \textbf{open} if it allows whatever we're considering to pass through.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:closed}
  A site or bond in a network is labeled \textbf{closed} if it doesn't allow whatever we're considering to pass through.
\end{definition}

And now for the percolation definitions.

\begin{definition}\label{def:sitepercolation}
  We say that we are considering \textbf{site percolation} if we let all of the sites in the network be open with probability $p \in [0, 1]$ and closed with probability $1-p \in [0, 1]$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\label{def:bondpercolation}
  We say that we are considering \textbf{bond percolation} if we let all of the bonds in the network be open with probability $p \in [0, 1]$ and closed with probability $1-p \in [0, 1]$.
\end{definition}

Now that we've defined site and bond percolation, what's the problem that we're trying to solve? In the case of water being poured on a porus medium, we would like to know
whether there is an open path from the top of the network to the bottom.

\begin{definition}\label{def:open}
  We say that a path in a network is \textbf{open} if:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item when considering site perolation, every site in the path is open.
    \item when considering bond percolation, every bond in the path is open.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:openly connected}
  Let $N=(V, E)$ be a network and let $A, B \in V$. The sites $A, B$ are \textbf{openly connected} if $\exists$ an open path connecting $A$ and $B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:openly disconnected}
  Let $N=(V, E)$ be a network and let $A, B \in V$. The sites $A, B$ are \textbf{openly disconnected} if $\nexists$ an open path connecting $A$ and $B$.
\end{definition}

The probability that an open path from the top of the network to the bottom exists depends on both our choices of both $p$ and $n$. As a result of our context, our value for $n$ should be
large---this is the case with most percolation models---but we shall use small $n$ for the sake of example and simplicity. Let us now fix $n$ and see what happens as we vary $p$. Obviously we have two trivial cases, $p=0$ and $p=1$,
where the network is completely openly disconnected and completely openly connected respectively (see
figures \ref{fig:p=0} and \ref{fig:p=1} below).

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{fig:p=1}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Examples of percolation for $p\in\{0, 1\}$.}
  \label{fig:probability extrema}
\end{figure}

What about when $p\in(0,1)$? Let's inspect three different values of $p$ on our network: $p=0.25$, $p=0.5$ and $p=0.75$ as shown in figures \ref{fig:p=0.25}, \ref{fig:p=0.5} and
\ref{fig:p=0.75} below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder}
    \caption{$p=0.25$}
    \label{fig:p=0.25}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder}
    \caption{$p=0.5$}
    \label{fig:p=0.5}
  \end{subfigure}
  \hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder}
    \caption{$p=0.75$}
    \label{fig:p=0.75}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Examples of percolation for $p\in(0,1)$.}
  \label{fig:probabilities}
\end{figure}

As one might expect, as $p$ increases, so does the "connectedness" of the network; i.e. the probability of having an open path from the top of the network to the bottom increases
with $p$. Also observe that, as $p$ increases we also get larger "clusters" of open connected sites or bonds.
