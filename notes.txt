__Good topic well approached__

- Only 5.5 pages.
- Abstract might not be needed but doesn't take anything away so might as well leave it.
- Find more references.
x Improper citations on Figure 2 and 3. Cite in the caption not before or after the figures.
- Definitions might be a problem? (Might not be mine or something like that)
- Content is too easy so find something a bit more complicated. Should be more towards second year level as opposed to first year level.
- Think about the narrative of the essay a bit more. Find a central topic and explain that more. (Maybe critical probabilites or application (probably this one))
- Subtle points not clearly explained
 - Definition 2.1: Confused by the definition itself. (This one needs citing). This whole part of the essay just needs a better explanation. What I'm describing is the expected number of s-clusters per site for the infinite case.
 - Proof (Theorem 2.1): Not a proof, it's an argument. May or may not be convincing, but it's definitely not a proof. Just don't write it as a proof. Doesn't actually have to be a proof and I won't lose marks for this.
- Definitions used wrongly. Sometimes I refer to definitions and sometimes I don't. Some definitions aren't really definitions either. Definitions 1.6 and 1.7 are not definitions because I'm missing lots of the conditions required to make it a formal definition.
- Definition of Critical Probability doesn't belong at the end of section 1.

Topic: Finite vs infinite networks.
Topic: Critical phenomena.
Topic: Topology of the networks.

Page 11: Discussion here is disconnected from the previous conversation.

Unclear what's happening in "The one dimensional case". A two sided case (Z) and a one sided case (N)

Everything around Definition 2.2 is strange and doesn't make much sense.

What is the distribution of the length of the clusters.

Worth shortening the section on one dimensional case.

Develop some theory for multidimensional cases so that I can effectively talk about theory.
